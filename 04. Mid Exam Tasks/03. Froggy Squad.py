# Create a program that helps you keep track of the frogs that are on the riverside.
# Because you are an extreme animal lover, you also name them.
# You will receive the names of the frogs that are already on the riverside on a single line,
# separated by a single space in the following format:
# "{frog1} {frog2} {frog3}â€¦ {frogn}"
# Then you will receive commands that describe their action. There are five possible commands:
