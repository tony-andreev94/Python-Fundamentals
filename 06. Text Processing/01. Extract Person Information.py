# Write a program that reads N lines of strings and extracts the name and age of a given person.
# The name of the person will be between '@' and '|'. The personâ€™s age will be between '#' and '*'.
# Example: "Hello my name is @Peter| and I am #20* years old."
# For each found name and age print a line in the following format "{name} is {age} years old."
